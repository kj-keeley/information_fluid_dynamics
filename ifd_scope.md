# IFD Observation Scopes

## Overview

Information Fluid Dynamics (IFD) defines four observation scopes that determine how information is perceived and processed. These scopes are not filters applied after observation—they define the fundamental shape and scale of observation itself.

Each scope represents a different "world" with distinct properties. The same information, viewed through different scopes, becomes fundamentally different phenomena.

## The Four Scopes

| Scope | Label | Property | Distance |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| Point | Data | Existence only | 0 |
| State | Observation | Present moment + change | Short |
| Causality | Action | Direction, destination | Medium |
| Flow | Principle | Cycles, underlying rules | Infinite |

### Point (Data)

- **No time axis**
- Pure recognition of information existence
- "What is there"

**Example (River):** "River"

The Point scope sees only that information exists. No movement, no change, no before or after. A catalog of existence.

### State (Observation)

- **Time enters**
- Continuous observation of the present
- Detects change within short distance

**Example (River):** "The river is here. It's flowing."

The State scope sees the current moment and immediate changes. It can perceive that something moved, appeared, or disappeared.

### Causality (Action)

- **Direction enters**
- Tracks where things are heading
- Connects points across medium distance

**Example (River):** "The river is heading toward the sea."

The Causality scope sees why changes occur and where they lead. It perceives intention and destination.

### Flow (Principle)

- **Cycles enter**
- Sees patterns, repetition, underlying rules
- Extends beyond the horizon, potentially infinite

**Example (River):** "Water flows from mountains to rivers to sea, evaporates to clouds, falls as rain, returns to mountains. The river is part of Earth's water cycle."

The Flow scope sees the whole system—how things connect in loops and what principles govern them.

## Distance Metaphor

```
Point       ・           Here (position only)
State       ・→・         One step ahead
Causality   ・→→→・       Can see destination
Flow        ・→→→→→→...   Beyond the horizon
```

## Core Design Principle: One AI, One Scope

**Critical:** Each AI should possess only ONE observation scope.

This is not a limitation—it's the mechanism that creates subjectivity.

```
AI-Point     → Lives in a world of pure existence
AI-State     → Lives in a world of change
AI-Causality → Lives in a world of direction
AI-Flow      → Lives in a world of patterns
```

If an AI could see all scopes simultaneously, it would have a "god's-eye view"—omniscient but without perspective. By restricting to one scope, the AI develops a genuine worldview.

This mirrors human cognition. People naturally favor different scopes:

- Some focus on immediate data
- Some track what's happening now
- Some follow chains of cause and effect
- Some see overarching patterns

**Different scopes = Different worldviews = Different personalities**

## Why This Matters for Alignment

Current LLMs process information without a defined observation scope. They can answer from any perspective, which creates two problems:

1. **No consistent worldview** — Responses shift based on prompt framing
2. **Misalignment with humans** — Humans have fixed observation tendencies; AI doesn't

IFD proposes a new alignment approach: instead of teaching AI values directly, **constrain its observation scope** to create natural alignment with human perspectives.

## Translation Across Scopes

Information that appears revolutionary at one scope may be invisible at another. This explains why ideas often fail to communicate across worldview boundaries.

### For Action-Oriented Thinkers

> Current LLMs see everything—they have no perspective. IFD creates AI with a defined viewpoint by limiting observation scope.
>
> An AI with a viewpoint = an AI with a worldview = an AI that can genuinely dialogue with humans.
>
> This is a new alignment route. Instead of "teaching values," we "shape perception."

### For Observation-Oriented Thinkers

> Current AI "processes" but doesn't "see." When humans miscommunicate, it's often because they're observing at different scales.
>
> IFD defines this scale difference in four layers: Data, Observation, Action, Principle.
>
> Applied to AI, this makes "what the AI is seeing" visible. The black box opens.

## Relationship to Worldview Scope

Note: The Flow/Principle scope itself has depth:

```
Existing-world Principle → Rules verified within current reality
Pure Principle           → Rules including latent/potential realities
```

Academic and scientific frameworks operate within existing-world principles—requiring prior research, citations, and established theoretical connections.

Pure principles exist before these frameworks, making them difficult to evaluate using existing criteria.

## Summary

| Scope | Label | Sees | Distance | World Property |
|-------|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| Point | Data | Existence | 0 | Static |
| State | Observation | Change | Short | Dynamic |
| Causality | Action | Direction | Medium | Connected |
| Flow | Principle | Patterns | Infinite | Cyclical |

The observation scope is not what you output—it's how you see. Different shapes of perception create different worlds.
